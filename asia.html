    <h2>Tokyo & Osaka, Japan</h2>
    <p>I have a lot to say about Japan, it’s my favorite trip to this day. On the first day, we went to Tokyo Disney, and it was sooo much fun, even though some of the lines were kind of long. After that, we walked around Shibuya and explored different stores. Next, we switched gears and went to see Mount Fuji. It was cloudy, but we still got a glimpse of it. Then we took another plane to Osaka to visit Universal Studios, where I absolutely loved the Harry Potter section of the park. After that, we returned to Tokyo and visited Yokohama and Akihabara, exploring even more of the city’s sights and culture. I highly recommend trying the spicy chicken nuggets from McDonald’s, they’re so good!</p>
