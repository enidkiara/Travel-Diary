    <h2>San Jose, Costa Rica</h2>
    <p>During our Alaska trip, we met people who lived in Costa Rica, so we went to visit them and ate at a cozy café. Our first stop in Costa Rica was at a series of three waterfalls, which were beautiful to see. The next day, we visited a volcano, went zip-lining, and later relaxed in the hot springs. After that, we traveled to Jaco, Costa Rica, where we went on a cool bike tour, spent time at the beach, rode horses, explored an abandoned place, and even ate some pizza.</p>
