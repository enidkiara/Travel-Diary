    <h1>Europe !</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Madrid, Spain</h2>
    <p>We walked around several charming pueblos near Madrid, exploring the narrow streets, local shops, and colorful buildings. While we were there, we also met up with my mom’s friend, whom she had met while living in Ireland, which made the visit even more special.</p>

    <h2>London, United Kingdom</h2>
    <p>My mom and I went on a Europe tour, and our first stop was London, UK. The very first thing we went to see was Buckingham Palace, where I got to watch the soldiers in uniform. I also saw the Tower Bridge go up to let a boat pass through, which was really cool to witness. And of course, we visited the famous clock, Big Ben, which looked even more amazing in person.</p>

    <h2>Amsterdam, Netherlands</h2>
    <p>Amsterdam was really cool with all the canals instead of regular roads. My mom wanted to visit Anne Frank’s hiding place, so we went there, and it was a powerful experience. I’d love to go back someday, especially now that I’m obsessed with Miffy!</p>

    <h2>Cologne, Germany</h2>
    <p>In Germany, we took a scenic boat ride along the river, enjoying the beautiful views of the surrounding towns and landscapes. During the trip, we also met another friend of my mom’s, who she had met while living in Ireland. It was fun to connect with her and hear stories about her experiences, making the trip feel even more personal and memorable.</p>

    <h2>Neuhausen, Switzerland</h2>
    <p>In Switzerland, the mountains were absolutely stunning, stretching as far as the eye could see. We climbed one of the tallest peaks, taking in breathtaking views along the way, but stayed in a cozy cabin that didn’t have air conditioning. Despite that, it was a memorable and unique experience being surrounded by such natural beauty.</p>

    <h2>Paris, France</h2>
    <p>Paris, France, was the place I was most excited to visit because I really wanted to see the Eiffel Tower. I remember getting out of the tour bus and immediately seeing the tower, I was so happy! I also bought a beret, tasted delicious macarons, and picked up fresh baguettes, which made the experience feel even more authentic.</p>
